# HW3 Dry Questions

1.  The class that implements the controller pattern is SnappingSheetController.
    It allows the developer to set the position of the snapping, in pixels or factor
    and with or without animation. Also, it allows to get information about the current
    state of the snapping (position, if it's currently snapping) and to control it,
    for example, to stop the snapping.
2.  The snappingCurve parameter controls the animation of the snapping.
3.  An advantage of InkWell is that it gives a graphic effect to tapping or other
    gesture, gives a way to decorate the widget. GestureDetector on the other hand,
    doesn't give a decorating option, but it can be used with a broader variety
    of gestures, deals well with a widget that changes it's size.
